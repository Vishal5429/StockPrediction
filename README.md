# 📈 AI-Based Stock Prediction App (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

A web-based stock prediction application that uses Artificial Intelligence concepts to forecast future stock prices. The entire app is built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, making it lightweight, fast, and easily deployable on any static hosting service like Netlify or GitHub Pages.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This application offers an intuitive and responsive frontend interface where users can:

- Search for a stock symbol.
- View historical trends.
- Predict stock price movement based on trained AI logic (simulated or embedded models).
- Visualize results using charts and graphs.

Although AI models typically run on the backend, this project **emulates AI behavior** directly in the browser using **precomputed data**, **simplified models**, or **API results**.

**🧠 How Prediction Works**
Since this project does not use a backend or real AI model in real time, predictions are made using:

- Predefined logic
- Basic statistical rules (e.g., moving averages)
- Or fetched prediction data from external APIs

This keeps the entire system client-side, ensuring high performance and easy deployment.
